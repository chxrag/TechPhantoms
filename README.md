Track-  Social Awareness
Two-thirds of people in India live in poverty: 68.8% of the Indian population lives on less than $2 a day. Over 30% even have less than $1.25 per day available - they are considered extremely poor. This makes the Indian subcontinent one of the poorest countries in the world; women and children, the weakest members of Indian society, suffer most.
India is the second-most populous country after China with about 1.2 billion people and is the seventh-largest country in the world with an area of 3,287,000 kmÂ². The highly contrasted country has enjoyed growth rates of up to 10% over many years and is one of the largest economies in the world, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of 1,644 billion US dollars. But only a small percentage of the Indian population has benefited from this impressive economic boom so far, as the majority of people in India are still living in abject poverty
What is the main reason for Hunger?
The main reason for hunger is poverty which is the result of unemployment. So the root cause of hunger is unemployment. The harsh reality of developing country INDIA is that people are not been able to earn even that much that they can fill their stomachs.
whenever we step out of our homes in the early morning we see a lot of daily wage workers in a large queue standing in the hope of getting RS500 a day so that they can feed their families and if they don't get work on that day their family has to sleep with a hope that they will get some food the next day.
Even if they get the work they are not paid what they really deserve. There is a lack of price consistency in the market. Labors are been dominated over by the rich bastard who doesn't even know how to talk to these poor laborers.
We have come up with an online platform for all the daily wage workers which will be providing work to these laborers at the proper price. All the laborers need to do is to register to our portal with their AADHAR CARD and then the people who need daily wage workers can directly contact them via our portal. And if some workers don't get work then we will be proving them food for their family that we will be getting from the nearby restaurants.
If we see the reality of restaurants then a lot of food is been wasted daily which can really feed these laborers. All we would be doing is collecting the wasted food from the restaurants and making food boxes and then supplying it to the laborers. This will indeed save the food and would be given to the needy.
BENEFITS
1. Solve the unemployment problem.
2. Labours will get proper wages and won't get exploited.
3. No labor would sleep hungry.
4.  Food wastage would be stoped and would be given to the needy.
